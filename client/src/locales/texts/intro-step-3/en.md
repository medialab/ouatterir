## Face-to-face workshops

We have been working for three years as part of a collective named ["Où atterir? (Where to land?)”](http://ouatterrir.fr/) at a third level (the pilot project), which requires face-to-face and long and meticulous meetings in small groups to relearn how to describe one's territory in a concrete and controversial way. We have learned from experience that the preparatory exercises require a lot of time, a relearning of collective life and an artistic culture that allows one to express oneself in a new way. We intend to lead to what we call ["new ledgers of complaints"](http://www.bruno-latour.fr/fr/node/792).

The goal is to be able to very quickly find the contact groups that have decided on this or that "protective measure". Either they are groups linked to a specific territory, or these groups are defined by a question, an activity, a company, a behaviour that they have chosen to modify by their "viral" action. These preparatory exercises are the only practical and simple way we have devised to take advantage of containment and to link the current health crisis with the ecological change that is coming.
