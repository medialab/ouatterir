## An online questionnaire to collect descriptions

The first level consists, quite simply, in using digital means to answer a number of questions about how individuals would see the next world. The advantage of this system is that it is easy to implement and there are many initiatives in this direction.

The disadvantage is that the numerical means, which require too little time and thought, encourage simple spontaneous expression. There is therefore a risk of accumulating wishful thinking but without measuring the difficulties, without pushing for an investigation, without even taking the trouble to describe the opponents of the recommended measures, and above all without seriously assessing what might be counterproductive or impractical.

Nevertheless, starting to collect and systematise your individual experiences and reflections, through a simple questionnaire, is essential to begin to imagine and implement new forms of collective action.
