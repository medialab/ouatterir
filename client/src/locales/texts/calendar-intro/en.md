While the first level of our exercises allows to express personal concerns, the second level has the objective to dig and explore further these expressions and to collectively amplify their resonances.

To this extent, the analysis of what has been collected through the questionnaire provides us with the possibility to propose some thematic contact groups. On the basis of what you have described in your answers, you will be invited to join some online activities organized around simple and short, but, hopefully, meaningful, descriptive procedures lasting 2 hours.

Engaged in the delicate operation of further nuancing and detail individual concerns by contrasting them collectively, these second series of exercises will constitute the basis for the face-to-face activities we are planning from September onwards.
