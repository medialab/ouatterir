## Creation of contact groups online, and discussions

Responses collected at level 1 are analyzed to identify themes and topics that will be useful for the organization of online workshops.

Once you have completed the questionnaire, if you are interested, we invite you to participate in one of these small contact groups who choose, with the help of moderators, to extend the description so that it is more in-depth and grounded in reality.

The objective is that from the 15th of May each invention of "preventive measures" is accompanied by online groups that are jointly investigating how to resist the return to "normal life". Here, web tools are not used to express an opinion, nor for gathering statistics, but to form a contact group capable of describing a situation and identifying allies as well as adversaries at the moment of deconfinement. The open-source infrastructure developed by the [m√©dialab at Sciences Po](https://medialab.sciencespo.fr/) has no other purpose than to facilitate the constitution of these moderation groups.
